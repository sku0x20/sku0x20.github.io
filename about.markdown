the less you know,
the more you advertise about it, 
even the minute detail,  

the more you learn,  
the more you know,  
the less you advertise about it...

its always a learning phase,  
theres always something you want to learn, try, explore,  
theres always something new out there...

finding myself in uncomfortable positions all the time,  
thanks to all the guys for discussing with me in those times...  

about me,  
is very simple,  
a guy who just wants to discuss,  
to learn, to explore, and know how much wrong he is,  
finding different meanings of the same stupid line... :)


ps: KISS, keep it simple stupid...
