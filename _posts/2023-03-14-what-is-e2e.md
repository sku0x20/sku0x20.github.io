should e2e be concerned about the binary.

like in my rust i am not running the binary and passing arguments to that.

i am saying if my codes integrity is an i am concerned about.
i am relying heavily on that fact that compiler will never produce the wrong binary. 

i am not testing compiler here only my cute. 
if it produces correct code for my tests including subsets.
it should do the same for the overall binary. 

some places i can understand, 
flashing can go wrong. 
that's why checks have to be performed. 

but here checks that compiler can go wrong. 
i don't know. 
it's compilers responsibility right?

again, one question that rises from this is, 
fine no deployment test but you have to test your dockerfile right. 
that container image. 

again. i would say isn't a health check more than enough for this. 

idk.
