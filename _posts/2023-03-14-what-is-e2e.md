should e2e be concerned about the binary.

like in my rust i am not running the binary and passing arguments to that.

i am saying if my codes integrity is an i am concerned about.
i am relying heavily on that fact that compiler will never produce the wrong binary. 

i am not testing compiler here only my cute. 
if it produces correct code for my tests including subsets.
it should do the same for the overall binary. 

some places i can understand, 
flashing can go wrong. 
that's why checks have to be performed. 

but here checks that compiler can go wrong. 
i don't know. 
it's compilers responsibility right?

again, one question that rises from this is, 
fine no deployment test but you have to test your dockerfile right. 
that container image. 

again. i would say isn't a health check more than enough for this. 

idk.


edit,  6:45pm
imo ping test is more enough as a e2e test for a system. 

cause each individuals are already treated 

and you can't test each individual path flow. 

that's the first reason we decoupled them to facilitate the tests. 

easy separation of use cases.
which are digestible. 

for these systems. like linux os.
it's like are these guys able to call the different libs.

no, all that is fine. 
but are you able to invoke the build library that's the thing. 

again. should library be concerned with it?
if someone is able to invoke.

but this is what testing in production is right?

yeah, as it autotyped, "great." 
that's the thing. 

it's testing, qa whatever you call. 
not tdd.
not e2e.(tdd)
not acceptance tests(tdd)

they are testing, quality assurance...
and all that. 
that everything worked out good for this...

like load test and all, 
this is testing, 
i would even say this should be testing in production.

it's not tdds concern...
